# potential-potato
This is my first project on github and my very first personal python project, I decided I wanted to make a game inspired by D&D to help me learn python. All of this code is written from scratch by me, I use resources like chat gpt, other repositories, and internet searches to help me learn. But as this is a learning project I would be cheating myself if I copied too much of anyone else's work. I dont plan on monetizing or even publishing this game, the graphics are not mine to sell. starting 8/28 I will be adding a lot more updates to show code literacy, to any potential employers take a look through the code, it may just be a game but it covers many subjects in python from basic if-thens, to loops, Classes, all the way to building my own AI model for the enemy movements. I hope to display code literacy on a deep level. I am currently not trained or acredited at this time, I taught myself everything I know. Thank you for checking the project out!
